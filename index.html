            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi! I'm Dileepkumar Kethe, an aspiring web developer in my previous company and a student in the ITMD541 course. My journey into the realm of web development began during my undergrad days when I stumbled upon a basic HTML tutorial. That spark of curiosity transformed into a passion, leading me to dive deep into the intricacies of web design and development.</p>
            <p>Over the years, I've honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript by taking the certification in Coursera. I've also had the privilege of working on a few freelance projects, helping local businesses establish their online presence. I believe that a website is more than just a collection of pages; it's a digital extension of oneself or one's business. That's why I always emphasize user experience and responsive design in my work.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I enjoy hiking, playing cricket, and indulging in my love for photography. I'm excited to embark on this academic journey, learn alongside my peers, and further enhance my web development skills.</p>
